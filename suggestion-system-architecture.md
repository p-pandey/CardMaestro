# CardMaestro Suggestion System Architecture

## Overview
The suggestion system maintains a pipeline that automatically generates and manages card suggestions for each deck while ensuring optimal user experience during review sessions.

## Core Components

### 1. Suggestion Count Management
- **Target**: Maintain 50 total suggestions per deck (visible + invisible combined)
- **Monitoring**: Sweeper continuously monitors suggestion counts across all decks
- **Triggering**: When total suggestions < 50, LLM API requests are triggered for the remaining count

### 2. Two-Stage Suggestion Pipeline

#### Stage 1: Invisible Suggestions (Awaiting Images)
- **Purpose**: Store LLM-generated suggestions that need image generation
- **Storage**: `invisibleSuggestions: [NSManagedObjectID: [InvisibleSuggestion]]`
- **Filtering**: Suggestions without image prompts are immediately discarded
- **State**: Not visible to users, awaiting image generation completion

#### Stage 2: Visible Suggestions (Ready for Review)
- **Purpose**: Store fully-processed suggestions ready for user interaction
- **Storage**: `deckSuggestions: [NSManagedObjectID: [Card]]` (published for UI binding)
- **Requirements**: Must have both content and generated images
- **State**: Available in suggestion review interface

### 3. Image Generation Process
The sweeper's image generation phase processes **all card types** systematically:

- **Current deck cards** (active, incomplete, archived)
- **Invisible suggestion cards** (awaiting promotion)
- **Visible suggestion cards** (already promoted)

**Processing criteria:**
- Card must have an `imagePrompt` property (non-empty)
- Card must not already have an existing image (`customImageData` is nil)
- Image generation uses Apple Intelligence â†’ OpenAI fallback strategy

### 4. Promotion System
**Trigger**: When image generation completes for an invisible suggestion
**Process**: 
1. Create Card entity from InvisibleSuggestion data
2. Apply generated image to card
3. Move from `invisibleSuggestions` to `deckSuggestions`
4. Remove from invisible list

**Critical safeguard**: 
```swift
guard !isUserReviewingSuggestions else {
    print("ðŸš« User is reviewing suggestions, blocking promotion")
    return
}
```

### 5. State Blocking During User Review
- **Purpose**: Prevent suggestion list changes while user is actively reviewing
- **Mechanism**: `isUserReviewingSuggestions` flag blocks both generation and promotion
- **Activation**: Set to `true` when SuggestedCardsView appears
- **Deactivation**: Set to `false` when SuggestedCardsView disappears

## Process Flow

```
1. Sweeper Check â†’ Count < 50?
   â†“ YES
2. LLM API Request â†’ Generate new suggestions
   â†“
3. Filter â†’ Keep only suggestions with image prompts
   â†“
4. Store in Invisible List â†’ await image generation
   â†“
5. Image Generation Sweeper â†’ Process all cards needing images
   â†“
6. Image Complete â†’ Promote to visible (if user not reviewing)
   â†“
7. Suggestion Available â†’ User can review in UI
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Seamless UX**: Users never see suggestions without images
2. **Performance**: Background processing doesn't block UI
3. **Consistency**: State blocking prevents mid-review changes
4. **Efficiency**: Batch processing and deduplication prevent redundancy
5. **Reliability**: Automatic cleanup and failure handling

## Implementation Notes

- All suggestion operations are @MainActor for thread safety
- Image generation uses background contexts to avoid blocking
- Deduplication prevents duplicate suggestions across all card states
- API rate limiting with delays between batch requests
