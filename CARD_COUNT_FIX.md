# 🐛 Card Count Display Issue - FIXED

## Problem Description
The home screen was incorrectly showing the number of cards as 1, even after creating multiple cards in a deck.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by SwiftUI not detecting changes to Core Data relationships. When cards were added to a deck, the computed properties like `totalCards` weren't triggering UI updates.

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Explicit Relationship Management**
```swift
// Before: Only set one side of relationship
newCard.deck = deck

// After: Set both sides explicitly
newCard.deck = deck
deck.addToCards(newCard)
```

### 2. **SwiftUI Observable Objects**
```swift
// Before: Views weren't observing deck changes
struct DeckRowView: View {
    let deck: Deck

// After: Properly observe deck changes
struct DeckRowView: View {
    @ObservedObject var deck: Deck
```

### 3. **Core Data Context Refresh**
```swift
// Added explicit refresh after saving
try viewContext.save()
viewContext.refresh(deck, mergeChanges: true)
```

### 4. **Views Updated**
- ✅ **DeckListView/DeckRowView**: Now uses `@ObservedObject var deck`
- ✅ **DeckDetailView**: Now uses `@ObservedObject var deck` 
- ✅ **DeckStatsView**: Now uses `@ObservedObject var deck`
- ✅ **CardCreationView**: Explicit relationship setup and refresh

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

**Test Steps:**
1. Create a new deck
2. Add multiple cards to the deck
3. Return to home screen
4. **Result:** Card count should show correct number (2, 3, 4, etc.)

**UI Elements That Should Update:**
- ✅ Home screen deck list showing "X cards"
- ✅ Progress bar reflecting actual completion percentage  
- ✅ Deck detail view showing correct total/new/due counts
- ✅ All stats updating immediately after card creation

## 🔧 Technical Details

**Core Data Relationship:**
```
Deck (1) ←→ (many) Card
- cards: NSSet?
- addToCards(_ card: Card)
```

**SwiftUI Observation:**
- `@ObservedObject` ensures views update when NSManagedObject changes
- `@FetchRequest` handles deck creation/deletion
- Computed properties now trigger UI updates properly

## ✅ Issue Resolved

The card count should now display correctly and update immediately when cards are added or removed from decks.

**Test the fix:**
1. Build and run the app
2. Create a deck and add multiple cards
3. Verify the home screen shows the correct card count
4. Check that all statistics update properly
